//! RED test: detection channel MUST be bounded and drop-newest under attack.
//! Bug: at 256k capacity, channel drains too slowly under sustained attack;
//! legitimate events get head-of-line-blocked. RFC 9411 heavy-impact condition.
//! GREEN: bounded capacity, drop-newest via try_send, dropped_events counter
//! exposed in IpcServerStats, dropped > 0 after burst > capacity.
//! Capacity raised 16k -> 64k (P1-7: single-flusher drain math at 1M eps);
//! the invariant under test is BOUNDED + DROP-NEWEST, not the exact number.
//! Semantic shedding (Vuln 2): low-signal events shed at 75% watermark,
//! high-signal events (status >= 400, anomalous fingerprint, >64 KiB) survive.
