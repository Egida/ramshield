# RamShield 0.5 — L7, HTTP/2, mesh and upstream integration

This release closes the four architectural limitations without replacing the
existing detection → WAL → EnforcementService → XDP pipeline.

## 1. L7 / HTTP/2 telemetry

Existing `ConnectionEvent` now accepts optional bounded `L7Metadata`:

- `host_hash`
- `route_hash`
- HTTP method
- HTTP version
- latency
- request/response bytes
- HTTP/2 stream counters

No raw URLs, headers or request bodies are stored by the detector.

The existing IPC `report_connection` / `report_connections` messages accept
`l7` as an optional field. Old clients remain wire-compatible because the
field is omitted when absent.

### HTTP/2 signals

RamShield scores:

- request rate;
- streams opened;
- streams reset;
- reset ratio;
- completed streams;
- maximum active streams.

The detector blocks through the existing `EnforcementService`; it does not
implement an HTTP/2 parser. A terminating proxy supplies the counters.

### Route rules

A bounded `detection.l7_rules` list can match a producer-side `route_hash`
and optional HTTP method. Rules can constrain request rate and/or HTTP/2 reset
ratio. At most 64 rules are accepted.

Example:

```toml
[detection]
l7_enabled = true
l7_rps_threshold = 500
l7_http2_min_streams = 32
l7_http2_reset_ratio_pct = 80
l7_block_ttl_secs = 300

[[detection.l7_rules]]
route_hash = 123456789
method = "Post"
max_rps = 50
max_http2_reset_ratio_pct = 70
```

## 2. Multi-node mesh

The existing `ramshield-mesh` AWORSet is now wired into the existing
`EnforcementService`.

When enabled:

```text
local block
  -> existing WAL/store/XDP
  -> existing AWORSet
  -> authenticated mesh delta
  -> peer AWORSet
  -> existing EnforcementService
```

Transport is authenticated TCP with an HMAC-SHA256 envelope and a 30-second
clock-skew/replay window. A bounded anti-entropy snapshot is exchanged every
2 seconds so a temporarily unavailable peer can converge after reconnect.

Remote tombstones are allowed to release only blocks that were applied from
mesh state; operator/local blocks are never blindly removed by a remote
unblock.

Configuration:

```toml
[mesh]
enabled = true
node_id = 1
listen_addr = "10.0.0.11:7900"
peers = ["10.0.0.12:7900", "10.0.0.13:7900"]
auth_key = "<hex shared secret>"
```

The shared key must be configured when mesh is enabled.

## 3. Uplink saturation / upstream escalation

The existing host detector cannot prevent an attack that has already filled
the access link. 0.5 therefore adds an upstream escalation signal while
leaving local enforcement untouched.

When configured, RamShield measures RX throughput on the configured interface
and compares it with the declared link capacity. A signal is raised when:

```text
uplink utilization >= saturation_pct
AND
observed request rate >= 50% of detection.rps_threshold
```

The signal is logged and, if configured, delivered to a generic HTTP webhook.
The webhook is deliberately vendor-neutral: it can invoke a provider's
scrubbing, RTBH or FlowSpec automation without putting BGP credentials inside
RamShield.

```toml
[upstream]
enabled = true
interface = "eth0"
link_capacity_mbps = 1000
saturation_pct = 90
poll_ms = 1000
webhook_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8787/ramshield/mitigate"
cooldown_secs = 60
```

The current adapter deliberately accepts `http://` only; production TLS can
be terminated by the deployment's existing local proxy. This avoids adding a
second TLS stack to the daemon.

## 4. Cross-platform boundary

The core telemetry, protocol, detection and userspace enforcement path remains
independent of XDP. XDP is still Linux-only and remains optional. Non-Linux
clients can therefore participate through the existing IPC telemetry and
control surface; Linux retains the kernel dataplane where available.

No Windows kernel firewall implementation is introduced into this release.
That is intentional: the project gains cross-platform participation without
creating a second kernel enforcement implementation.

## Integrity rules

These features must not:

- bypass WAL;
- mutate Store outside `EnforcementService`;
- write XDP directly from detection;
- introduce an unbounded per-route map;
- trust unauthenticated mesh messages;
- let mesh unblocks remove local/manual blocks;
- claim that host-level mitigation defeats a saturated uplink.
